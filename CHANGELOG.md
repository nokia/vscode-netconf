# NETCONF CLIENT for Visual Studio Code

## Change Log

Notable changes to the "vscode-netconf" extension are documented in this file.

### [1.1.0]
* Client capabilities are now configurable in the `netconf.serverList`.
  By default, `vscode-netconf` is sending the `base:1.0` and `base:1.1`
  capabilities to the server. By making the capabilities configurable,
  the desired framing mechanism can be enforced. In addition, it is
  possible to enable device-level feature like private candidates in
  Nokia SR OS.
* The execution time for RPCs is now captured and shown to the user.
  This is to get some initial idea on performance for a given
  `edit-config` or `commit` RPC. It is targeted for integrators
  to optimize the communication to the server and to implement
  response time-outs.

  The execution time is only shown to RPCs that return a simple
  `</ok>` as part of the confirmation dialogue. It's not available
  for RPCs that return detailed responses like `<get>`, `<get-config`.
  For those cases, it is shown in the console-log only.

### [1.2.0]
* Improved logging using a dedicated vsCode OUTPUT channel called `netconf`.
* Support for vsCode REMOTE SSH in case you don't have direct connectivity
  to your network devices. Use `Remote SSH` to connect to your SSH jumphost,
  and install this NETCONF extension using vsCode on the remote host.
  When using containerized environments most propably the host running
  containerlab is your SSH target.

### [1.2.1]
* Improved error-handling for Ciena supporting XML tags to fix:
  https://github.com/nokia/vscode-netconf/issues/2

### [2.0.0]
* New user-interface: NETCONF view (check activity bar/side bar)
  Note: Old UI is not longer available
* Allow multiple concurrent connections to multiple servers
  Note: Dedicated OUTPUT channels are used per server
* Adhoc NETCONF connections from containerlab extension
* Ask user for password, if authentication has failed

### [2.1.0]
* Use hostname for containerlab (instead of IP)
* Names for output channels (logging) using id (instead of hostname/IP)
* Provide password for new connections
* Taxonomy consistency: managed devices
* Connections are displayed with session-id
* Option to clone managed device entries
* Various error-handling improvements
* Update entries w/ cross-navigation to settings json

### [2.1.1]
* UTF-8 support w/ chunked framing
* Support for ssh-transport logging
* Send custom <rpc> works again from `editor/title/run`
* Corresponding output channel opens automatically when selecting a connection (spotlight)

### [2.1.2]
* Improved logic to trigger custom <rpc> from open XML document
  Note: using activeTabGroup/activeTab (if scheme is XML)

### [2.2.0]
* Password storage using vsCode secrets

### [2.2.1]
* Changed settings scope to "machine", avoiding conflicts with workspace
* Put new connection into spotlight automatically to reduce number of clicks
* Show notification in status bar only if notifications are available
* Show session-id in status bar

### [2.3.0]
* `NETCONF CONNECTIONS` are not accessible from EXPLORER to avoid unnecessary
  navigation between explorer view and netconf view. Connection management
  (subscriptions, disconnect, spotlight) remains in the netconf view. Shortcuts
  for NETCONF RPCs (get, get-config , validate, discard, commit) are only
  available from explorer view. Custom RPC is accessible from explorer view
  plus statusbar (for spotlighted node).

### [2.3.1]
* Align shortcuts for active `NETCONF CONNECTIONS` in EXPLORER and NETCONF
  sidebar to avoid confusion and to improve usability.
* Enable SSH keepalives by default (5sec / 3 intervals) to automatically
  detect if sessions are still alive.

### [2.4.0]
* Add message-id if not provided as part of the request
* New operation to download device yang-library

### [2.4.1]
* Fix: netconf subscription icon/menu entry does not appear
* Fix: adding netconf examples did not work
